<h1>My PoE1 Configs</h1>
This is a simple repo to store my Path of Exile 1 and 2's configurations including my lootfilter sounds i may currently use. 
<br/>
It's more a personal repo to facilitate my life configurating PoE1 on Linux, for some reason the cloud storage doesn't work on linux, so i'm doing this instead to save my configs lmao
